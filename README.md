# Weather Analysis 
*Surf n' Shake Shop*

## Purpose of report
Weather analysis for potential investor, W. Avey,  as supplemental information to previously discussed Surf n' Shake Shop business proposal. 


## Statistical Analysis:
Using Hawaii weather data, I calculated temperature statistics for peak months for tourism: June and December. Looking at average, max and min temperatures recorded, we are able to predict minimal changes in weather conditions across a 6 month span. 

### Results:

  * Average temperatures in June and December are within three degrees of each other: 71F in December versus 74F in June. This supports my claim that surfing as an industry in Oahu is stable year-round. 
  * Maximum temperatures also vary very little: 83F on December versus 85F in June, which are ideal temperatures for an amateur surfer, out main customer base.
  * Minimum temperatures range from 56F in December to 64F in June. Though not extremely cold temps, we could expect much fewer customers, as only serious professional surfers are willing and prepared to surf in such cold water. However, I have proposed several marketing strategies as well as the customer loyalty program and communityh events to help drive traffic and sales (and mitigate the less-than-ideal conditions that inevitably will arise).

### Summary:
The forecast for Surf n' Shake Shop looks clear and sunny! Temperatures throughout the year, based on the data, is consistent and Oahu seems to be the perfect location for our shop. 
Just to be thorough, I will run additional queries looking at precipitation, as previously discussed, and a couple on specific surfing conditions, such as swell height, swell period, offshore wind, and tide levels. I want your full confidence that every piece of data supports this business investment, and our new partnership.
